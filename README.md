Hospital Management System

**PROBLEM   STATEMENT:**

The aim of this project is to design a  Hospital Management System using appropriate Data Structures and Algorithms to ensure efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data. The system should also be user-friendly, with an intuitive user interface that allows hospital staff to perform tasks easily and efficiently.

**DATA STRUCTURES USED:**
1. Queue
2. Doubly Linked list
3. Binary Search Tree
4. Hash Table
5. Arraylist

**CONCLUSION:**

A Healthcare Management System is crucial for efficient and effective healthcare delivery, it is essential for improving quality of patient care, reducing healthcare costs.
The hospital management system using DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) is an innovative solution that utilizes efficient algorithms and data structures to optimize the management of hospitals. The system provides a range of features such as patient management, staff management, inventory management, and billing management, which enable hospitals to improve their operational efficiency and provide better patient care.
